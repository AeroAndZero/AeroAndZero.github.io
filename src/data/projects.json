Each step, from incision to sawing/drilling to fitting implants and testing their rigidity, can be carried out in detail and at utmost precision. Animations, ambience, and effects are heavily optimized for VR and are as realistic as possible.<br/><br/>User's activity such as time and mistakes are captured and their analysis are generated to the user while sending them to the database. They are also given hints and actual surgery videos for more insights.<br/><br/>User interface, experience, and story board were designed on Figma. Models were designed in Maya and later on blender and were imported with shape keys and animations."

You have to score points and eliminate the other team to win providing a harmless paintball-like encounter.<br/><br/>The goal was to create a game where the distane between players in real-life and virtually is approximately the same. This was a challange because of the tracking limit Quest 2 headset has. We overcame this by starting the players on the same spot and have them move to their specific area after they have joined the game. This was proven to be perfect as we did not have a real life arena built prior to this project for testing.<br/><br/>Another issue was to manage the authority of objects between players during the multiplayer game. This created a hold of development but we eventually figured it out. This was one of the most entertaining project we built in a while."
