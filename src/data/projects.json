You have to score points and eliminate the other team to win providing a harmless paintball-like encounter.<br/><br/>The goal was to create a game where the distane between players in real-life and virtually is approximately the same. This was a challange because of the tracking limit Quest 2 headset has. We overcame this by starting the players on the same spot and have them move to their specific area after they have joined the game. This was proven to be perfect as we did not have a real life arena built prior to this project for testing.<br/><br/>Another issue was to manage the authority of objects between players during the multiplayer game. This created a hold of development but we eventually figured it out. This was one of the most entertaining project we built in a while."
